# Awesome JavaScript VSCode Extensions Pack

## Purpose

I'm a frontend engineer and have been working in JavaScript with React for a long time. This vscode extension pack is entirely
written for my personal use cases which contains all my most favorite vscode extensions to work efficiently. Extremely useful for me while setting up vscode from scratch and may be for you also if you are working in the similar tech stack.

**Enjoy!**
